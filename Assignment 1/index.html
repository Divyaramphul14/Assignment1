        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The experience of building my first portfolio website was gratifying yet challenging. As a student who was working with HTML, CSS and 
            Javascript without any guidance, this portfolio was an essential task for me to be able to develop my skills. It helped me to better
            understand the concepts of HTML, CSS and JAvascript.The process of building this portfolio consisted of various steps, such as selection of a
            template, customisation of layout and design, writing the content of the portfolio and doing research work to be able to find how to apply certain CSS styling, Codes in HTML and Javascript.
            Each step while building the portfolio required great attention to details. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There were several benefits of building the portfolio for instance, showcasing my skills and experience while building the portfolio.
            Another benefit of building this portfolio is that it enabled me to identify my strengths and weaknesses of Html, css and Javascript coding.
            However, I faced a lot of challenges during the creation of the website such as deciding the layout of the portfolio, writing the codes while 
            following the Industry Best Practices and finding a Javascript code to put in the Portfolio.
